# Data Generation: Water on Iron Surfaces

Iron is widely used in numerous applications, and is susceptible to corrosion through formation of iron oxide (rust). The initial stages of this process are not well understood, but involve the interaction between iron surfaces, water, and oxygen. In this project you will run ab-initio molecular dyanamics (AIMD) simulations of water molecules interacting with an iron surface and process the data to extract chemical insights about the process.


## Midterm Goal:

Complete at least one AIMD simulation of the iron (110)/water interface using the SPARC-X code. The trajectory should contain at least 100 images.


### Midterm Deliverables:

* ASE .traj or .json file containing the trajectory.
* SPARC input files used to generate the trajectory.

## Final Goal:

Run at leat 5 AIMD trajectories of water at an iron (110) surface with various coverages of O and/or OH. Analyze the result using radial distribution functions to determine the impact of adsorbed O and/or OH.

### Final Deliverables:

* ASE .traj or .json file containing the trajectories.
* SPARC input files used to generate the trajectories.
* Plots of the RDF for each AIMD trajectory.
